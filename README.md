This project explores the potential of creating CoreData object models from Swift code by applying macros to class and property declarations.
It aims to provide an alternative to Xcode's object model editor which:
  - unifies specification of object model and custom logic as Swift code;
  - enables composition of object models;
  - makes property metadata available for tasks such as data import and export;
  - simplifies support for non-standard attribute types.

This project is a work in progress and, as Swift macros are an experimental feature, cannot be used directly to build applications for distribution on the App Store.
